# revolut_cli

response:

Areas of improvements:
- attention to details (implicit requirements were missed ie. empty/blank keyword)
- testing skills (checks ex message as well when checking exception was thrown, start testing with positive scenarios, use TDD)
- better naming especially in test (having descriptive test names creates kind of documentation for your class as by reading the test names you are able to understand what tested class does)
- implementation speed
